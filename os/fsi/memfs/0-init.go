// Package memfs offers a filesystem in memory.
//
// It was taken from Steve Francia's afero and extended.
// Most importantly, memMapFs.fos (previously memMapFs.fos)
// now holds the full path of each directory.
// Before that, directory names had to be unique.
// Same for InMemoryFile.memDir.
// The type memDirMap was removed; just use builtin map semantics.
// The entire pathing logic was redone.
// There is no os-dependent filepath anymore;
// everything is unix forward slashed.
//
// Creation happens with New(options...)
//
// fileinfo.Name() now returns the basename of the file;
// just as os.FileInfo.Name() does.
//
// All internal usage of Name() had to be rewritten.
//
// The locking approach remains a mystery to me.
// There are multiple locks and mutexes in Remove/Rename/Open and Close.
// I kept them in place.
// Strangely, the InMemoryFile.memDir map is *not* synced at all,
// though I think it should.
// Strangely, Remove() did not unregister with parent.
